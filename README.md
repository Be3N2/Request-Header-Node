# Request-Header-Node
Node app that returns info about user accessing it.

Simple node app that when used returns json output containing the ip address, language,and system of the user calling it. 
Project pretty small and simple but hardest part was looking for request documentation and the best thing I found for that 
was express' website http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req but still not everything needed but it helps a lot!

Here is the main page:
https://basicuserdata.glitch.me/

The api call is:
https://basicuserdata.glitch.me/whoami

It returns output similar to this: 
{"ipaddress": "78.198.31.159", "language": "en-US",  "software": "Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64"}
